# Journey-to-become-a-Penetration-Tester


# 👋 Hello Everyone!

My name is **Jeremiah Britton**, and I’m on a journey.

**What kind of journey, you ask?** I’m working toward becoming a **Penetration Tester**!

I’ve been in the field of cybersecurity for a little over three years, gaining hands-on experience across a wide range of areas: Email security, SOAR, SIEM, EDR, firewalls, cloud platforms, proxies, DNS security—you name it. I’ve developed a broad foundation, but one thing I’ve realized I’m missing is a **specialty**.

After some reflection, conversations with my spouse, and thinking deeply about what excites me most, I’ve found myself drawn to **Ethical Hacking**, **Penetration Testing**, and **Red Team operations**.

Before entering cybersecurity, I served 20 years in the U.S. Army. While I wasn’t a cyber professional during my service, I did engage in aspects of information and asset security as a **Military Police Senior Non-Commissioned Officer**. That experience continues to shape my mindset and discipline as I pursue this new path.

## 🎯 Goals

Here’s what I’m aiming to accomplish on my journey to becoming a Penetration Tester:

- ✅ Build a strong foundation in ethical hacking principles and methodologies  
- ✅ Gain hands-on experience with tools like Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Wireshark, and more  
- ✅ Earn industry-recognized certifications (e.g., CompTIA Security+, eJPT, OSCP)  
- ✅ Contribute to open-source security projects and CTF challenges  
- ✅ Document everything I learn to help others and reinforce my own understanding

## 🛠️ Current Projects

These are the projects I’m actively working on and updating here on GitHub:

- **TryHackMe & Hack The Box Walkthroughs**  
  Documenting my progress and solutions as I work through various rooms and labs.

- **Home Lab Setup**  
  Building a virtual lab environment using VirtualBox/VMware, Kali Linux, vulnerable machines, and more.

- **Tool Reviews & Notes**  
  Creating detailed notes and mini-guides on tools I’m learning—what they do, how to use them, and real-world applications.
